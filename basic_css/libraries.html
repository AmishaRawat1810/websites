        <h1>The Architecture of Libraries</h1>
        <p>
          Libraries have long served as more than storage for books.
          They are designed environments intended to support focus,
          reflection, and quiet collaboration.
        </p>

        <h2>Spaces for Stillness</h2>
        <p>
          Reading rooms are often arranged symmetrically, with long
          tables aligned beneath tall windows. Natural light plays a
          central role in shaping the atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>
          Materials are selected for durability and warmth. Wood,
          stone, and fabric soften sound while preserving structure.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Modern Adaptations</h2>
        <p>
          Contemporary libraries incorporate digital labs and shared
          workspaces alongside traditional stacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet the architectural goal remains consistent: create a
          setting that encourages sustained attention.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>A Public Commitment</h2>
        <p>
          The continued investment in libraries reflects a belief that
          learning requires space. Not merely information, but room
          to engage with it thoughtfully.
