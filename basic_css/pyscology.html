    <h1>The Psychology of Waiting</h1>

    <p>
      Waiting is an unavoidable part of human experience.
      Airports, hospitals, and digital loading screens all
      impose moments of suspended action.
    </p>

    <h2>Perceived Duration</h2>

    <p>
      Time feels longer when attention is unoccupied.
      A minute without stimulation stretches beyond
      its measured length.
    </p>

    <p>
      Designers often attempt to reduce perceived delay
      by providing feedback, animation, or information.
    </p>

    <h2>Shared Anticipation</h2>

    <p>
      Waiting in groups creates subtle social dynamics.
      People adjust posture, eye contact, and movement
      based on shared uncertainty.
    </p>

    <p>
      Silence amplifies awareness.
      Small sounds gain significance.
    </p>

    <h2>Constructive Pause</h2>

    <p>
      Not all waiting is negative.
      Deliberate pauses allow reflection and recalibration.
    </p>

    <p>
      In an era of instant response, intentional delay
      can become a form of resistance.
