    <h1>The Disappearance of Public Phone Booths</h1>

    <p>
      For much of the twentieth century, public phone booths stood on street
      corners,
      inside train stations, and near busy markets. They provided a simple
      service:
      a reliable way to connect with someone across town or across the country.
    </p>

    <h2>A Shared Utility</h2>

    <p>
      Phone booths were once treated as essential infrastructure. Cities
      installed
      them near hospitals, post offices, and bus terminals. Travelers relied on
      coins or prepaid cards to make urgent calls. For many, they represented
      independence in unfamiliar places.
    </p>

    <p>
      The design was straightforward: a small enclosure, a receiver attached by
      a
      cord, and clear instructions mounted on metal panels. Their function
      rarely
      changed for decades.
    </p>

    <h2>The Mobile Shift</h2>

    <p>
      As mobile phones became smaller and more affordable, the need for shared
      communication spaces declined. Carrying a personal device eliminated
      waiting,
      coins, and time limits.
    </p>

    <p>
      Within a single generation, booths moved from necessity to curiosity.
      Some were removed quietly. Others were repurposed as mini libraries or
      art installations.
