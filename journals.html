    <h1>The Evolution of Personal Journals</h1>

    <p>
      Personal journals have existed in many forms, from bound
      leather books to encrypted digital apps.
    </p>

    <h2>Private Reflection</h2>

    <p>
      Historically, journaling required physical commitment.
      Ink pressed into paper created a tangible record of thought.
      Mistakes remained visible.
    </p>

    <p>
      The permanence of handwriting often shaped how carefully
      ideas were formed.
    </p>

    <h2>Digital Convenience</h2>

    <p>
      Modern journaling platforms allow infinite edits.
      Entries can be reorganized, searched, and backed up instantly.
    </p>

    <p>
      The medium encourages fluidity but reduces physical presence.
    </p>

    <h2>Balancing Medium and Meaning</h2>

    <p>
      Whether analog or digital, journaling persists because
      reflection remains valuable.
    </p>

    <p>
      The form evolves, but the impulse to record experience continues.
